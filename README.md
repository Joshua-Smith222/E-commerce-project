# Getting Started with Create React App
# 🛒 GameHub - E-Commerce Product Listing App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project is a simple e-commerce product listing app built using **React**. It was developed as part of the **Advanced JavaScript & Intro to React module** to demonstrate mastery of components, props, and state without using external frameworks like Bootstrap.

## Available Scripts
---

In the project directory, you can run:
## 🌟 Features

### `npm start`
- 🧱 **Modular React Components** (`App`, `ProductList`, `ProductItem`, `ProductDetail`)
- ⚛️ **State Management** using `useState` for product data and category filtering
- 📦 **Props** passed cleanly from parent to child components
- 🎨 **Custom CSS Styling** — responsive, modern, and gaming-themed UI
- 🔍 **Category Filter** — view products by category: Keyboard, Mouse, Headset
- 🖼️ **Dynamic Image Rendering**
- 🧭 **React Router** — for product detail pages
- 🧠 **Hover Effects**, sticky nav bar, and animated buttons

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
---

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
## 🚀 Technologies Used

### `npm test`
- React (18+)
- React Router DOM (v6)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Custom CSS

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
---

### `npm run build`
## 📁 Folder Structure

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
## ✅ How to Run

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
1. Clone the repo:

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecom-product-app.git
cd ecom-product-app
```

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
2. Install dependencies:

## Learn More
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the app:
